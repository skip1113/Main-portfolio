# My Porfolio

## Live Link to my Portfolio: "https://skip1113.github.io/Main-portfolio/"

Welcome to my portfolio. I have created this project from what I learned becoming a Full-stack Developer. 
Feel free to take a look at what I've made during my time at University of Denver. I am excited for my career deployment, and to learn more. My portfolio is where you can find my contact and more information about myself and my writen code. 

Please enjoy this portfolio about my work and experience. I look forward to connect and discuss further questions about my career path.
